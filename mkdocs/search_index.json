Basically a software mixer, audio processor, VST host, recorder and many more things)\n\n\nThis is probably the most flexible way to handle Audio a single computer setup - you can separate audio sources like applications,\ngames, VoIP applications (Skype, Discord etc.), control if only you or your stream should be able to hear them, process them\nin real time and record them separately if needed.\n\n\nThe idea is that you create several virtual Windows audio devices, for example one for games, one for other applications,\nwhatever you need. Those devices feed into your DAW (along with your microphone) which you can use to control volumes and\nwhatever else you want to do with the audio. Then you send the audio from there into another virtual Windows audio device\nwhich you can select in OBS/XSplit.\n\n\nInstalling the necessary tools is fairly quick, but you will have to invest some time into learning how to use\nthe DAW that you will be sending your audio through if you have never used one.\n\n\nInstalling the tools\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you have an ASIO driver. If you have an audio interface or any other (semi-)professional sound card it should have\none, otherwise you will need to use \nAsio4All\n. I won't cover how to set up Asio4All here, but it's really not hard.\n\n\nInstall \nSynchronous Audio Router\n\n\nPick your favorite DAW software and install it.\n\n\n\n\nSome nice ones to choose from:\n\n\n\n\nAbleton Live\n: Developed for live performing and recording alike, has nice ways to use oneshot clips and extremely good MIDI\ncontroller support\n\n\nStudio One\n: A bit more conventional, but still very slick UI. Has a free version, but unlike the paid one it doesn't support\nVST plugins and the integrated plugin selection is rather small\n\n\nBitwig\n: A bit like Ableton Live, but with a different flavor to it. Also somewhat performance oriented\n\n\nReaper\n: UI is a bit harder to get into at first, but also very powerful and by far the cheapest of them all. Also, the trial\nlasts 60 days and nothings stops you from using it after it expires. You should probably buy it after that, but nobody's forcing\nyou to.\n\n\n\n\nThey all have their own advantages and disadvantages, it can't hurt to download some of the trial versions and just see\nwhat you like best. If it needs to be as cheap as possible, go with Reaper. \nI'll explain the rest of this guide with Reaper\nin mind because of that, but it's easily transferable to any of the other ones.\n\n\nSetting up the Driver\n\n\nIf you want to get going as fast as possible, download this \nconfiguration file\n and save it to \n%appdata%\\SynchronousAudioRouter\n.\nIt has windows playback devices for Applications, Games, VoIP and Music, windows recording devices for the Stream and just your\nVoice and will send all Steam games to the \"Games\" device without having to change anything.\n\n\nIf you have something else in mind, feel free to set up your own configuration directly in the driver.\n\n\n\n\nStart your DAW with admin privileges (the SAR driver currently requires this to work)\n\n\nOpen the Audio driver settings. In Reaper, Options/Audio/Device.\n\n\nSelect ASIO Driver: Synchronous Audio Router\n\n\nClick on \"ASIO Configuration\" and then select your driver under \"Hardware Interface\"\n\n\n[set up windows devices here if necessary]\n\n\nNow you need to add the new ASIO channels to your DAW. In Reaper, just select the first/last device each like shown\nin the picture. You'll have to manually create and assign channels in most of the other DAWs. The first devices on the list\nbelong to your hardware, they might be named differently for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it, now you need to set up the DAW itself the way you want it.\n\n\nSetting up your routing in the DAW\n\n\nFirst, create a channel for your Microphone. To do that, press \nCTRL + T\n to create it, and then set up the channel. This\nis basically the same for any channel, whether it's a Microphone, an Application channel or something entirely different.\n\n\n\n\nSelect the correct input channel\n\n\nTurn Monitoring to ON\n\n\nArm the Track for Recording\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to hear things coming from this input. Next, repeat this for all the input channels you have.\nIt's probably a good idea to set all your channels to -6dB initially, so you never run into clipping issues. You can\nalways make up the lost volume in a limiter on the master.\n\n\nNow you'll want to set up a bus channel for your stream mix and send the microphone channel to a separate output. Create\na channel, open its routing panel and select \nAdd new hardware output -\n Stream Mix 1/Stream Mix 2\n (assuming you used\nthe config file from above). Deselect \nSend to Master\n, and use \nAdd new receive -\n Add receives from all tracks\n. After\nthis the routing panel for the channel should look something like this: \n\n\nAlternatively, you could also just add the Stream output to your master channel, however you won't be able to exclude\ncertain channels from the stream if you do this. With the setup like above, you could just remove the send to stream from\nany of the individual channels or turn down its volume to -inf dB and you'll have muted just that channel for the stream,\nbut you can still hear it.\n\n\nFinally, add the \nVoice 1/Voice 2\n outputs to your Microphone channel.\n\n\nYou can now select the two audio devices (Voice and Stream) in the OBS settings. They will both be windows recording devices, so they'll\nbe listed under \nMic/Auxiliary Audio Device\n in OBS Studio. There should be no other Audio devices selected in the OBS settings.\nOBS should pick up your Audio now.\n\n\nThe final Reaper mixer panel looks like this now:\n\n\n\n\nNext, you could add some VST plugins to your voice channel (like I have done here) and continue to customize things however\nyou need them.",
