Here's a list of some **free** quality VST plugins for common tasks in streaming. These are mostly useful for enhancing your microphone
sound and making your voice "fit in" with other audio sources, but sometimes it may also be useful to add processing to
sound coming from games or applications.

Keep in mind that they are simply tools - if you don't know how to use them, you might do more damage than good, but if you
use them well they can make a big difference.
